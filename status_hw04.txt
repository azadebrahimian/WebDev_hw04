1. What's your name?
Azad Ebrahimian

2. What hostname did you deploy your app to?
hw04.wumbo.casa

https://github.com/azadebrahimian/WebDev_hw04

4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
All of it

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
I was able to successfully deploy

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
I definitely feel a lot more comfortable than before the assignment, 
but I am no where near comfortable to start from scratch without any help.

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
The calculator was the biggest struggle for me. It took a long time to
find an algorithm to convert an expression to postfix, and then translate
that algorithm in elixir. I also struggled heavily with deploying. A lot
of the time my code would not update/display properly and I was left to 
play around with random commands until it worked.
